0,EMO,Jane E. Trust,ClearBridge Energy MLP Opportunity Fund Inc.,"The Funds investment objective is to provide long-term investors a high level of total return with an emphasis on cash distributions. Under normal market conditions, the Fund will invest at least 80% of its Managed Assets in securities of MLPs in the energy sector. For purposes of the 80% policy, the Fund considers investments in MLPs to include investments that offer economic exposure to public and private MLPs in the form of equity securities of MLPs, securities of entities holding primarily general partner or managing member interests in MLPs, indirect interests in MLPs (such as I-Shares) and debt securities of MLPs. The Fund considers an entity to be within the energy sector if it derives at least 50% of its revenues from the business of exploring, developing, producing, gathering, transporting, processing, storing, refining, distributing, mining or marketing natural gas, natural gas liquids (including propane), crude oil, refined petroleum products or coal. Currently and as the Fund makes its initial investments, the Fund intends to focus its investments in MLPs with operations in crude oil, natural gas liquids and refined products infrastructure. This reflects ClearBridges current belief that the combination of structurally higher global oil prices and the increased supply of domestic oil and natural gas liquids - due primarily to recent shale gas discoveries - makes MLPs focused on these liquid products well positioned for long term growth. While ClearBridge currently anticipates that liquid product-related infrastructure MLPs will be the Funds primary focus, the dynamic nature of the energy markets may create new and potentially more attractive opportunities over time. Should macro energy, political, regulatory or tax considerations evolve, and other types of MLPs become more attractive, ClearBridge may look to invest in these new opportunities. In addition, changes in energy markets or related adverse political, regulatory or tax developments could cause these beliefs and expectations to not be realized. For as long as Energy MLP Opportunity is in the name of the Fund, the Fund will invest at least 80% of its Managed Assets in the MLPs in the energy sector. The Fund may not change its policy to invest at least 80% of its Managed Assets in MLPs in the energy sector unless it provides stockholders with at least 60 days written notice of such change. The Fund may invest up to 20% of its Managed Assets in securities of issuers that are not MLPs. This 20% allocation may be in any of the securities described in this Prospectus and the SAI, including securities of non-MLP companies engaged primarily in the energy sector. Such issuers may be treated as corporations for United States federal income tax purposes and, therefore, may not offer the tax benefits of investing in MLPs.",New York Stock Exchange,Asset Management,cs,Financial Services,

Under normal market conditions, the Fund will invest at least 80% of its net assets, plus the amount of any borrowings for investment purposes, in equity securities. GPAM will manage the Fund utilizing a covered call strategy developed by GPAM to seek to utilize efficiencies from the tax characteristics of the Funds portfolio. GPAMs covered call strategy will seek to follow a dynamic rules-based methodology to obtain broadly diversified exposure to the equity markets, either through investments that replicate the economic characteristics of broadly diversified exposure to the equity markets, including exchange-traded funds or other investment funds that track equity market indices, or through investments in individual common stocks along with other securities and instruments. The Fund will have the ability to write call options on indices and/or securities which will typically be at- or out-of-the money. GPAMs strategy typically targets one-month options, although options of any strike price or maturity may be utilized. The Fund will seek to earn income and gains through both dividends paid by on securities owned by the Fund and cash premiums received from selling options. Although the Fund will receive premiums from the options written, by writing a covered call option, the Fund forgoes any potential increase in value of the underlying securities above the strike price specified in an option contract through the expiration date of the option. To the extent GPAMs strategy seeks to achieve broad equity exposure through a portfolio of common stocks, the Fund would hold a diversified portfolio of stocks, whereas to the extent GPAMs equity exposure strategy is implemented through investment in broad-based equity exchange-traded funds and other investment funds or instruments, the Funds portfolio may comprise fewer holdings.",New York Stock Exchange,Asset Management,cs,Financial Services,

The Fund intends to initially implement its investment objective by purchasing in the secondary market the equity and junior debt tranches of collateralized loan obligation (CLO) vehicles. Structurally, CLO vehicles are entities that were formed to originate and manage a portfolio of loans. The loans within the CLO vehicle are limited to loans which meet established credit criteria and are subject to concentration limitations in order to limit a CLO vehicles exposure to a single credit. A CLO vehicle is formed by raising various classes or tranches of debt (with the most senior tranches being rated AAA to the most junior tranches typically being rated BB) and equity. The CLO vehicles which the company intends to focus on will be collateralized primarily by Senior Loans, and will generally have very little or no exposure to real estate, mortgage loans or to pools of consumer-based debt, such as credit card receivables or auto loans. It may also invest, on an opportunistic basis, in other corporate credits of a variety of types.
